          <h1>A Tribute To Bill Evans</h1>
          <p>
            Bill Evan's piano works were all about inciting subtlties. He played melodies that tickles the tips of your ears, and to accompany the tickling, he striked chords that tuck you into your sheets for a sound night's sleep.

            A personal favorite album of mine by Bill Evans is the Bill Evans Trio - Portrait In Jazz. The simplicity of the trio, comprised of the piano, the upright bass, and the jazz drum kit, are, to me, essentials to finding the joy in life's evolving hues of emotion. The three instruments conversate intimately with one another.

            I created the sketch on the right to reflect on my admiration for Mr. Evan's playing style and his knack for subtlty. The subtle and constant color variation changing in opacity along with the meandering but nearly well organized placements of the rectangles that almost resemble piano keys are my impression of his artistic signature.
