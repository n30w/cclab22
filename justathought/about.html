            "just a thought" - a project by neo alabastro
        </p>
        <p>
            just a thought is a project about thinking. I sought to create something similar to an interactive poem. The visual displays are metaphorical illustrations of the thoughts being orated. All of the music was created by me as well. To play, just click.
